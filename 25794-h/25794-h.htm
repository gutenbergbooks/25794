<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE.</h2>


<p>In presenting to the public this volume the
compiler wishes to disown any attempt at a
complete collection of Indian legends; both her
knowledge of arch&aelig;ology, and the time allowed for
the completion of the work are inadequate to such
an achievement. She has attempted to gather the
more noticeable legends already in verse in order
to stimulate interest in the scenery and romance
of her State. From its name&mdash;Minnesota&mdash;to its
floral emblem&mdash;the moccasin flower&mdash;the State
everywhere bears the impress of former occupation.
About every lake, forest, and valley clings the
aroma of romance in the form of name or legend
of the vanished Red Man.</p>

<p>The indistinct memory of his loves, wars, and
adventures is growing rapidly fainter, until even
the story-teller himself is confused as to the relation
between event and locality. It has therefore
seemed wise to link indissolubly scene and incident,
that the poetry of those who have here lived and
loved may not be completely displaced by the
prosaic commerce of the white man.</p>

<p>The compiler wishes also to express her thanks
to the writers who have allowed their works to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
reappear in this volume: To Rev. E. D. Neill, D.D.,
for much valuable counsel, and to Houghton,
Mifflin &amp; Co., for permission to make extracts from
Hiawatha.</p>

<h2>The Lone War-Path.</h2>

<h3>A STORY OF SIOUX AND BLACKFOOT.</h3>


<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">O'er a vast prairie stoops the sultry night;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The moon in her broad kingdom wanders white;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">High hung in space, she swims the murky blue.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Low lies yon village of the roaming Sioux&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Its smoke-stained lodges, moving toward the west,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By conquering Sleep invaded and possessed.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">All there, save one, own his benign command;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their chief has lately left this little band,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And up the glittering path of spirits fled;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus his young widow, not a twelvemonth wed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In yonder solitary tent conceals<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The aching hope, the trembling pangs she feels.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">How breathless is the night! None saw it rise&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That black cloud stealing up the glassy skies&mdash;<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Till threatening murmurs, loud and louder grown,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Burst from its swelling bosom, and the moon<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Slips into brief oblivion, while a glare<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As of far, flickering torches, seems to bear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The challenge of the gods. Awake, awake!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Make ready for the tempest, ere it break!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Drive tent-pins deeper, stretch the covering tight&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hobble the ponies, scattering in affright<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Before the thunder-peals. When all is fast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Keep vigil, then, till the gods' wrath be past!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">A sudden fury sweeps the somber plain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In dizzy slant descends the sheeted rain;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sharp lightnings rend in twain the sable gloom,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While, cannon-like, the unchained thunders boom!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On this wild tumult of the angry skies<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No ear discerns a woman's thrilling cries;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet, ere its sullen echoes die away<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In caverns where the mocking spirits play,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Faint, but rejoicing, on a couch of skins,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A new-made mother lays her lusty twins!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The wise men of the tribe strange signs relate&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This stormy birth portends a stormy fate&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And since the warring heavens, that should affright,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Called forth these daring boys on such a night,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their names must own the event that marked their birth&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The elder, "As-he-walks-he-shakes-the-earth,"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The younger twin, "Coming-his-voice-is-heard"&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus saith the oracle.<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i12">This mighty word<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Darkens the mother's heart with nameless dread,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But casts no shadow on the unconscious head<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of either sturdy twin. Their mutual play<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With joyous echoes fills the livelong day!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From helpless infancy to boyhood grown,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One brother never had been seen alone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till sudden sorrow bowed the mother's pride&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The elder sickened and untimely died.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The gossips point to him that's left alone&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"He, too, will die, for half himself is gone!"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At first, distraught he seemed&mdash;unlike a child;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He ate not, slept not, neither spoke nor smiled.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then sought the forest&mdash;wandered there alone<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For days&mdash;his tender mother frantic grown&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till he returned to her, and smiling, said,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"My spirit meets and talks with him that's dead!"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thenceforth he seemed as one who, hand-in-hand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Walks with a brother in the spirit land.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Among the Sioux, in those heroic days,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When certain valor gained the meed of praise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The seasoned warrior, old and full of scars,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Counted the hero of a hundred wars,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet craving higher honor, went alone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On foot, to meet the enemy, and won<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(If he returned victorious), on that day<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A proud distinction.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i8">Fancy her dismay,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The mother of a tender youth untried,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When he, the twin we know of, seeks her side<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
<span class="i0">And murmurs in her ear, who loves him so,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Mother, my elder brother bids me go<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On a lone war-path." Knowing well 'twere vain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To plead with him, her tears must fall like rain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On 'broidered moccasins for those dear feet;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His pouch, her choicest store of pounded meat<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Must fill before the dawn, which sends him forth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On foot, alone, to pierce the savage north.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Now to the journey gallantly addressed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(Still at his twin's mysterious behest),<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He kills a buck with branching horns, and takes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The tongue and heart for food&mdash;then straightway makes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A sacrifice to that stern deity&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The thunder-god&mdash;who rules his destiny.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On a fair, level spot, encompassed round<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With trees, he pins the carcass to the ground;<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Prays for success, his burning heart's desire,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then sleeps beside the embers of his fire.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">How wearisome, how long the painful days<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That follow, as he treads by unknown ways<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A mazy wilderness, where lurk unseen<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All perils challenging his eye-sight keen.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet on&mdash;with tattered shoes and blistering feet&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To find the savage foe he longs to meet!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At last, to wearied eyes that search in vain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The far-off meeting-place of sky and plain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A fleck of dazzling whiteness doth appear.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The youth exclaims, "My enemy is near!"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Toward that white gleam his cautious steps are bent,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Surely some roving Blackfoot's lonely tent.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Nearer and nearer creeps, with cat-like tread,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The watchful Sioux. Above his lowered head<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The plumy grasses rear a swaying crest;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His sinuous motion ripples the broad breast<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of this ripe prairie, like a playful wind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That leaves its shining, silver track behind.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">A tent of skins&mdash;that piercing eye saw true&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wondrously white and beautifully new;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In all the colors known to savage art,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A life-size figure with a blood-red heart<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Guards the low door. But who shall more divine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Since not a thread of smoke, nor sound, nor sign<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of human presence makes the story clear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Save yonder dappled ponies grazing near?<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Crouched in deep grass the wily Indian lies,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ambitious that lone hunter to surprise&mdash;</span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a><br /></span>
<span class="i0">His gaze the wide horizon ranges low<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the first glimpse of his returning foe;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The painted lodge full many a glance doth win&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Each moment may reveal who lurks within!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">At last it moves&mdash;that swinging oval door&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At last she steps upon the prairie floor,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shading her dark eyes from the dazzling ray&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A dusky princess, lovelier than the day!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No matron, to her hidden foeman's sight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Has ever seemed so radiantly bright.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her dress is rich, in style unlike the Sioux.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(These belles in doe-skin have their fashions, too!)<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Her virgin train sweeps down the glade,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Kissing the cavern's mouth of shade;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She smiles upon the singing brook,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With sparkles filling every nook<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That lurks about its dimpled face,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Giving its deepest shadows grace,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And breathing on its grassy mane<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A gloss it ne'er can hope to gain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beneath the sun's more kingly ray.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Weirdly the purling waters play<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In her embrace; then break away<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To vanish under bending boughs,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">With this fair scene all these are met<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The moments passing seem to be<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Endowed with all eternity,</span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in this lonely spot, love found<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Brings the whole universe in bound!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But, hark! what sound the breezes bear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Turning her gladness to despair?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wenonah trembles like a reed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With hunted look she turns to plead:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"O Wenijishid, leave me, quick!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For dangers gather round thee thick.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We are discovered, and thy death<br /></span>
<span class="i0">May hang upon each wasted breath.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fly for thy life! Too late! too late!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Together we must meet our fate."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He smiles, and there with dauntless front<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Would meet the coming foemen's brunt;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But she who will not leave his side<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bears in her hand his warrior pride,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And hopes of joyous life with her<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are sweeter than the battle's stir.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His war-whoop's taunt rings through the glen,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While answering come the cries of ten.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wenonah clasps his brawny arm,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And lest his love might come to harm<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He turns to where his birchen boat<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Seems chafing to be set afloat;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, ere their foes have gained the strand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The light canoe beneath his hand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Leaps off before a foaming track.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He flings a yell of triumph back,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And grimly smiles as on he flies<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To hear their disappointed cries;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet lest they may too soon pursue,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He urges on the flight anew.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He plies the paddle with a will,</span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a><br /></span>
<span class="i0">They skim the waves,&mdash;but swifter still<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A vengeful arrow cleaves the air,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To sink between his shoulders bare.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The shock is cruel, and the blade<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Falls from his hand; his powers all fade<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like thought, and plunging on his face,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Deathlike he lies. Now to his place<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wenonah springs; with bloodless lip,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With gleaming eye and nervous grip,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She works the paddle with a force<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of which but love could be the source.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beyond the range of bow, she flings<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The blade aside and fiercely brings<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her wounded hero to her breast.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now sadly called, now wildly pressed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He breathes at last a feeble sigh,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, feeling sure he will not die,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She labors strongly, full of hope<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And nerved with any fate to cope.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She gains the shore, and stoutly bears<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her chief through brush and wild beast lairs.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All through the night she speeds her flight.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To where his people's fires burn bright.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When friendly, helping hands are found,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And she has given him to their care,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She sinks upon the leafy ground,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Panting like a hunted hare.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her faithful powers have filled their task,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their sacred trust no more need ask,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And now the goal is gained, they bind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oblivion's charm around her mind.<br /></span>

<h3>A LEGEND OF ST. ANTHONY FALLS.</h3>

<span class="i0">More glorious than the twilight gleam<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Passion, and joy. A woman's love she had<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For ornament; on gala days was clad<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In garments of the softest doeskin fine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With shells about her neck; moccasins neat<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were drawn, like gloves, upon her little feet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Adorned with scarlet quills of porcupine.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Innocent of the niceties refined<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That to the toilet her pale sisters bind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet much the same beneath the outer rind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She was, though all unskilled in bookish lore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A sound, sweet woman to the very core.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Winona's uncle, and step-father too,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was all the father that she ever knew;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By the Absarakas<a name="FNanchor_4_5" id="FNanchor_4_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_5" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> her own was slain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Before her memory could his face retain.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Two bitter years his widow mourned him dead,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And then his elder brother she had wed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">None loved Winona's uncle; he was stern<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And harsh in manner, cold and taciturn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And none might see, without a secret fear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Those thin lips ever curling to a sneer.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And yet he was of note and influence<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Among the chieftains; true he rarely lent<br /></span>
<span class="i0">More than his presence in the council tent,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And when he rose to speak disdained pretence<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of arts rhetoric, but his few words went<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Straight and incisive to the question's core,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And rarely was his counsel overborne.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Raven was the fitting name he bore;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And though his winters well-nigh reached three-score,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Few of his tribe excelled him in the chase.</span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a><br /></span>
<span class="i0">A warrior of renown, but never wore<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The dancing eagle plumes, and seemed to scorn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The vanities and follies of his race.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I said the Raven was beloved by none;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But no, among the elders there was one<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who often sought him, and the two would walk<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Apart for hours, and converse alone.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The gossips, marveling much what this might mean,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whispered that they at midnight had been seen<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Far from the village, wrapped in secret talk.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They seemed in truth an ill-assorted brace,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But Nature oft in Siamese bond unites,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By some strange tie, the farthest opposites.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gray Cloud was oily, plausible, and vain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A conjurer with subtle scheming brain;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Too corpulent and clumsy for the chase,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His lodge was still provided with the best,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And though sometimes but a half welcome guest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He took his dish and spoon to every feast.<a name="FNanchor_5_6" id="FNanchor_5_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_6" class="fnanchor">[5]</a><br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Priestcraft and leechcraft were combined in him,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Two trades occult upon which knaves have thriven,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Almost since man from Paradise was driven;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Padding with pompous phrases worn and old<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their scanty esoteric science dim,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And gravely selling, at their weight in gold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Placebos colored to their patients' whim.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Man's noblest mission here too oft is made,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In heathen as in Christian lands, a trade.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Holy the task to comfort and console<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The tortured body and the sin-sick soul,</span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a><br /></span>
<span class="i0">But pain and sorrow, even prayer and creed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are turned too oft to instruments of greed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The conjurer claimed to bear a mission high:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mysterious omens of the earth and sky<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He knew to read; his medicine could find<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In time of need the buffalo, and bind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In sleep the senses of the enemy.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Perhaps not wholly a deliberate cheat,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And yet dissimulation and deceit<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oozed from his form obese at every pore.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Skilled by long practice in the priestly art,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To chill with superstitious fear the heart,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And versed in all the legendary lore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He knew each herb and root that healing bore;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But lest his flock might grow as wise as he,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Disguised their use with solemn mummery.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When all the village wrapped in slumber lay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His midnight incantations often fell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His chant now weirdly rose, now sank away,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As o'er some dying child he cast his spell.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sometimes through his frame strange tremors ran&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Magnetic waves, swept from the unknown pole<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Linking the body to the wavering soul;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And swifter came his breath, as if to fan<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The feeble life spark, and his finger tips<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were to the brow of pain like angel lips.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No wonder if in moments such as these<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He half believed in his own deities,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thought his sacred rattle could compel<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The swarming powers unseen to serve him well.</span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a><br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Raven lay one evening in his tent<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With his accustomed crony at his side;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Around their heads a graceful aureole<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of smoke curled upward from the scarlet bowl<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Gray Cloud's pipe with willow bark supplied.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Winona's thrifty mother came and went,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her form with household cares and burdens bent,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fresh fuel adds, and stirs the boiling pot.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Meanwhile the young Winona, half reclined,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Plies her swift needle, that resource refined<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For woman's leisure, whatsoe'er her lot,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The kingly palace or the savage cot.<br /></span>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The cronies smoked without a sign or word,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Passing the pipe sedately to and fro;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Only a distant wail of hopeless woe,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A mother mourning for her child, was heard,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Gray Cloud moved, as though the sound had stirred<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some dusty memory; still that bitter wail,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rachel's despairing cry without avail,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That beats the brazen firmament in vain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Since the first mother wept o'er Abel slain.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At length the conjurer's lips the silence broke,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Softly at first as to himself he spoke,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till warmed by his own swarming fancies' brood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He poured the strain almost in numbers rude.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">My spirit grew as tall and bold as they;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We tossed the ball and flushed the noble prey<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O'er happy plains from human footsteps far;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And when our high chief's voice to arm for war<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rang out in tones that rent the morning sky,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">None of the band exulted more than I.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">A god might gaze and tremble at the sight<br /></span>

<span class="i0">With bow and shield and flame-tipped arrows all,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rushing together at our leader's call,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like storm clouds sweeping round a mountain height.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Up from their caverns swarming, when they heard<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The Water-Demon and his sons arose,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And answered back the challenge of their foes.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With horns tumultuous clashing like a herd<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of warring elks that struggle for the does,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They lashed the wave to clouds of spray and foam,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through which their forms uncouth, like buffaloes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Seen dimly through a morning mist, did loom,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or isles at twilight rising from the shore.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Though we were thirty, they at least fourscore,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">As shooting stars that in the rice-moon fall.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rent by our beating wings the cloud-waves swung<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In eddies round us, and our leader's roar<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Smote peal on peal, and from their bases flung<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The rocks that towered along the trembling shore.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">A Thunder-Bird&mdash;alas, my chosen friend,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Cleaving the tumult like a lightning streak,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Smote with a fiery hiss the watery plain;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His upturned breast, where gleamed one fleck of red,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His sable wings, one moment wide outspread,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Blackened the whirlpool o'er his sinking head.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The Water-Demon's sons by scores were slain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By our swift arrows falling like the rain;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The Water-Demon with one favorite son<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The vapors, thinly curling from the shore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Faint musky odors to our nostrils bore.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The air was stilled, the silence of the dead;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sun, just starting on his downward path,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A rosy mantle o'er the prairie shed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Save where, like vultures, ominous and still,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We clustered close, on sullen wings outspread;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sometimes, with a momentary chill,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A giant shadow swept o'er plain and hill,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A Thunder-Bird careering overhead,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Seeking the track by which the foe had fled.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">That split the prairie with a silver seam,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The fleeing Water-Demon and his son;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like icicles they glittered in the beam<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Still struggling up from the horizon's rim.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His sleeping anger kindled at the sight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our leader's eyes glowed like a flaming brand.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thrilled by one impulse, all our sable band<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dove through the gathering shadows of the night<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On wings outshaken for a headlong flight.</span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Anger, revenge, but more than all the thirst,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The glorious emulation to be first,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stung me like fire, and filled each quivering plume.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With tenfold speed our sharp beaks cleft the gloom,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A swarm of arrows singing to the mark,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We hissed to pierce the foe ere yet 'twas dark.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Still up the stream the Water-Demons fled,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their bodies glowed like fox-fire far ahead;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But every moment saw the distance close<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Between our thirsty spear-heads and our foes.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Louder the blast our buzzing pinions made<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than mighty forest in a whirlwind swayed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The giant cliffs of Redwing speeding back,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like specters melting from a cloudy wrack,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Melted from view in our dissolving track.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Kaposia's village, clustered on the shore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With sound of snapping poles and tipis riven,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Vanished like swan's-down by a tempest driven.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stung by our flight, the keen air smote us sore<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As ragged hailstones; on, still on, we strained,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And fast and faster on the chase we gained,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But neck and neck the fierce pursuit remained,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till close ahead we saw the rocky walls<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And at their base the Water-Demons lay:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The panting chase at last had turned to bay.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then thrilled my nerves with more than mortal strength;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A breath of Deity was in the burst<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That bore me out a goodly lance's length<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To meet the Water-Demon's son accurst.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His evil horn clanged hollow on my shield</span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Just as my spear transfixed him through and through;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A moment towering o'er the foam he reeled,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then sank beneath the roaring falls from view.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A dying yell that haunts me yet he gave,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And as he fell the crippled water coiled<br /></span>
<span class="i0">About him like a wounded snake, and boiled,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lashing itself to madness o'er his grave.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">We knew not where the parent Demon fled;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">None of our spears might pierce his ancient mail,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Some watery realm he wanders, and 'tis said<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That he is changed and bears a brighter form,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">O'erlooking Minnetonka's shore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A grove enchanted lured of yore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lured to their deepest woe and joy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A happy maiden and careless boy;</span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lured their feet to its inmost core,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where like snowy maidens the aspen trees<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Swayed and beckoned in the breeze,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While the prairie grass, like rippling seas,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Faintly murmuring lulling hymns,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rippled about their gleaming limbs.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">There is no such charm in a garden-close,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">However fair its bower and rose,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As a place where the wild and free rejoice.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor doth the storied and ivied arch<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Woo the heart with half so sweet a voice<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As the bowering arms of the wild-wood larch,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where the clematis and wild woodbine<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Festoon the flowering eglantine;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where in every flower, shrub, and tree<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is heard the hum of the honey-bee,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the linden blossoms are softly stirred,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As the fanning wings of the humming-bird<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Scatter a perfume of pollen dust,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That mounts to the kindling soul like must;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where the turtles each spring their loves renew&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The old, old story, "coo-roo, coo-roo,"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mingles with the wooing note<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That bubbles from the song-bird's throat;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where on waves of rosy light at play,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mingle a thousand airy minions,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And drifting as on a golden bay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The butterfly with his petal pinions,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From isle to isle of his fair dominions<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Floats with the languid tides away;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where the squirrel and rabbit shyly mate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And none so timid but finds her fate;</span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a><br /></span>
<span class="i0">The meek hen-robin upon the nest<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thrills to her lover's flaming breast.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Youth, Love, and Life, 'mid scenes like this,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Go to the same sweet tune of bliss;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">E'en the flaming flowers of passion seem<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pure as the lily buds that dream<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On the bosom of a mountain stream.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Such was the grove that lured of yore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Overlooking Minnetonka's shore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lured to their deepest woe and joy<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A happy maiden and careless boy,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lured their feet to its inmost core;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where still mysterious shadows slept,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While the plenilune from her path above<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With liquid amber bathed the grove,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That through the tree-tops trickling crept,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And every tender alley swept.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The happy maiden and careless boy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Caught for a moment their deepest joy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the iris hues of Youth and Love,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A tender glamour about them wove;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But the trembling shadows the aspens cast<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From the maiden's spirit never passed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the nectar was poisoned that thrilled and filled,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From every treacherous leaf distilled,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her veins that night with a strange alloy.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Swift came the hour that maid and boy must part;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A glow unwonted, tinged with dusky red<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Winona's conscious face as home she sped;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And to the song exultant in her heart,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beat her light moccasins with rhythmic tread.</span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a><br /></span>
<span class="i0">But at the summit of a little hill,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Along whose base the village lay outspread,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A sudden sense of some impending ill<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Smote the sweet fever in her veins with chill.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The lake she skirted, on whose mail&egrave;d breast<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rode like a shield the moon from out the west,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She neared her lodge, but there her quick eye caught<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The voice of Gray Cloud, and her steps were stayed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For over her of late an icy fear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Brooded with vulture wings when he was near.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">She knew not why, her eye he never sought,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor deigned to speak, and yet she felt dismayed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At thought of him, as the mimosa's leaf<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Before the fingers touch it shrinks with dread.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She paused a moment, then with furtive tread<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Close to the tipi glided like a thief;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With lips apart, and eager bended head,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She listened there to what the conjurer said.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">His voice, low, musical, recounted o'er<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Strange tales of days when other forms he wore:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How, far above the highest airy plain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where soars and sings the weird, fantastic crane,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wafted like thistle-down he strayed at will,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With power almost supreme for good or ill,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Over all lands and nations near and far,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beyond the seas, or 'neath the northern star,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And long had pondered where were best to dwell<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When he should deign a human shape to wear.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Whether to be of them that buy and sell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With fish-scale eyes, and yellow corn-silk hair,</span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or with the stone-men chase the giant game.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But wander where you may, no land can claim<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A sky so fair as ours; the sun each day<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Circles the earth with glaring eye, but sees<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No lakes or plains so beautiful as these;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor e'er hath trod or shall upon the earth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A race like ours of true Dakota birth.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our chiefs and sages, who so wise as they<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To counsel or to lead in peace or war,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And heal the sick by deep mysterious law.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our beauteous warriors, lithe of limb and strong,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fierce to avenge their own and others' wrong,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What gasping terror smites their battle song<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When, night-birds gathering near the dawn of day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or wolves in chorus ravening for the prey,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They burst upon the sleeping Chippeway;<a name="FNanchor_11_12" id="FNanchor_11_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_12" class="fnanchor">[11]</a><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their women wail whose hated fingers dare<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To reap the harvest of our midnight hair;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Swifter than eagles, as a panther fleet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A hungry panther seeking for his meat,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So swift and noiseless their avenging feet.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">He ceased, and soon, departing through the night,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She watched his burly form till out of sight.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And then the Raven spoke in whispers low:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Gray Cloud demands our daughter's hand, and she<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unto his tipi very soon must go."</span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Winona's mother sought to make reply,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But something checked her in his tone or eye.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Again the Raven spoke, imperiously:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Winona is of proper age to wed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her suitor suits me, let no more be said."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Winona heard no more; a rising wave<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of mingled indignation, fear, and shame<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like a resistless tempest shook her frame,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The earth swam round her, and her senses reeled;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Better for her a thousand times the grave<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than life in Gray Cloud's tent, but what could she<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Against the stern, implacable decree<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of one whose will was never known to yield?<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Winona fled, scarce knowing where or how;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fled like a phantom through the moonlight cool,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Until she stood upon the rocky brow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That overlooked a deep sequestered pool,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where slumbering in a grove-encircled bay<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lake Minnetonka's purest waters lay.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unto the brink she rushed, but faltered there&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Life to the young is sweet; in vain her eye<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Swept for a moment grove and wave and sky<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With mute appeal. But see, two white swans fair<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gleamed from the shadows that o'erhung the shore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like moons emerging from a sable screen;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Swimming abreast, what haughty king and queen,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With arching necks their regal course they bore.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Winona marveled at the unwonted sight<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of white swans swimming there at dead of night,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her frenzy half beguiling with the scene.</span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unearthly heralds sure, for in their wake<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What ruddy furrows seamed the placid lake.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Almost beneath her feet they came, so near<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She might have tossed a pebble on their backs,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When lo, their long necks pierced the waters clear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As down they dove, two shafts of purest light,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And chasing fast on their descending tracks,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A swarm of spirals luminous and white,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Swirled to the gloom of nether depths from sight.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then all was still for some few moments' space,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So smooth the pool, so vanished every trace,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It seemed that surely the fantastic pair<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had been but snowy phantoms passing there.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Winona hardly hoped to see them rise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But while she gazed with half-expectant eyes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The waters strangely quivered in a place<br /></span>
<span class="i0">About the bigness of a tipi's space,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where weirdly lighting up the hollow wave<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beat a deep-glowing heart, whose pulsing ray<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now faded to a rosy flush away,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now filled with fiery glare the farthest cave.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A shapeless bulk arose, then, taking form,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bloomed forth upon the bosom of the lake<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A crystal rose, or hillock mammiform,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And round its base the curling foam did break<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As round a sunny islet in a storm;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And on it poised a swiftly changing form,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With filmy mantle falling musical,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And colors of the floating bubble's ball,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fair and elusive as the sprites that play,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bright children of the sun-illumined spray,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Mid rainbows of a mountain waterfall.</span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then mingling with the falling waters came<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In whispers sibilant Winona's name;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So indistinct and low that voice intense,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That she, half frightened, cowering in the grass<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In much bewilderment at what did pass,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till thrice repeated noted not its sense.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">She rose, and on the very brink defined,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Against the sky in silhouette outlined,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Erect before the Water-Demon stood.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Again those accents weird her wonder stirred,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And this is what the listening maiden heard:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Thy fate, Winona, hangs on thine own choice<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To scorn or heed the Water-Demon's voice.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gone are thy pleasant days of maidenhood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And evil hours draw nigh, but knowest thou not,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That what thou fleest is the common lot<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of all thy sisters? Thou must be the bride<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of one thou lovest not, must toil for him,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Watch for his coming, and endure his whim;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Must share his tent, and lying at his side<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Weep for another till thine eyes grow dim.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he, so fondly loved, will pass thee by<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Indifferent with cold averted eye;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">E'en he, whose wanton hands and hated arms<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Have crushed the fair flower of thy maidenhood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Will weary of thy swiftly-fading charms,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And seek another when thy beauty wanes.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Aha, thou shudderest; in thy tense veins,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fierce and rebellious, leaps the mingling blood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of countless warriors, high of soul and brave;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And would'st thou quench their spirit 'neath the wave?</span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is Gray Cloud's life more dear to thee than thine?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The village sleeps, unguarded is his tent,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy knife is keen, and unto thee is lent<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A spell to-night of potency malign.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cradled in blissful dreams alone he lies,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he shall stray so deep in sleep's dominions,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He would not waken though the rushing pinions<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of his own Thunder-Bird should shake the sky.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All freedom-loving spirits are with thee,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Strike hard and fear not as thou would'st be free;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lest thine own hatred prove too weak a charm,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Water-Demon's hate shall nerve thine arm."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The Water-Demon sank and disappeared,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And faint and fainter fell those accents weird,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Until the air was silent as the grave,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Still as December's crystal seal the wave.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Homeward again Winona took her way.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How changed in one short hour! no longer now<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The song-birds singing at her heart, but there<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A thousand gnashing furies made their lair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And urged her on; her nearest pathway lay<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Over a little hill, and on its brow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A group of trees, whereof each blackened bough<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bore up to heaven as if in protest mute<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Its clustering load of ghastly charnel fruit,<a name="FNanchor_12_13" id="FNanchor_12_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_13" class="fnanchor">[12]</a><br /></span>
<span class="i0">The swaddled forms of all the village dead&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Maid, lusty warrior, and toothless hag,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The infant and the conjurer with his bag,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Peacefully rotting in their airy bed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As on a battle plain she saw them lie,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fouling the fairness of the moonlit sky;</span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And heavily there flapped above her head,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some floating drapery or tress of hair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Loading with pestilential breath the air<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That fanned her temples, or the reeking wing<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of unclean bird obscenely hovering;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And something crossed her path that halting nigh,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At the intruder glared with evil eye,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She hardly heeded passing swiftly by.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Leaving behind that hideous umbrage fast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What wraith escaping from its tenement,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Winona through the sleeping village passed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And pausing not, to Gray Cloud's tipi went,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Laid back the door, and with a stealthy tread,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Entered and softly crouched beside his head.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her gaze that seemed to pierce his inmost thought,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Keen as the ready knife her hand had sought,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And through the open door the slant moonbeams<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Smiting the sleeper's face awaked him not.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He vaguely muttered in his wandering dreams<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of "medicine," and of the Thunder-Bird.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As if to go, her knife she half returned;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whether her woman's heart with pity stirred,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or superstitious awe, she slightly turned,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But gazing still, over his features came<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The semblance of a smile, and his arms moved,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Clasping in rosy dreams some form beloved,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And his lips moved, and though no sound she heard,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She thought they shaped her name, and a red flame<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Leaped to her brain, and through her vision passed;</span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a><br /></span>
<span class="i0">A raging demon seized and filled her frame,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And like a lightning flash leaped forth her knife:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That cold keen heart-pang is his last of life;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Water-Demon is avenged at last.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">She struck but once, no need hath lightning stroke<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For second blow to rend the heart of oak,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor waited there to see how Gray Cloud died;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her fury all in that fierce outburst spent,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Early next morning, as the first faint rays<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of sunlight through the rustling lindens played,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Two children sent to seek the conjurer's aid,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gazed on the sight, with horror and amaze,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Gray Cloud's lifeless body rolled in blood.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fast through the village spread the news, and stirred<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With mingled fear and wonder all who heard.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">When all the demons of the earth and air<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like raging furies were embattled there,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She, peering fearfully, amid the swarm<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Flitting athwart the flashes of the storm,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By fitful gleams beheld the Raven's form.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To her he spoke not since the fateful night<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His chosen comrade passed from human sight,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">"Winona," said the Raven, in a tone<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of stern reproof that on the instant froze<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All thought of mirth, and when she met his eye,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As by a serpent's charm it fixed her own;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The hate and anger of a soul intense<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were all compressed in that remorseless glance,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The coldly cruel meaning of whose sense<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Smote down the shield of her false innocence.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She strove to wrest her eye from his in vain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Held by that gaze ophidian like a bird,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As in a trance she neither breathed nor stirred.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And gazing thus an icy little lance,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Smaller than quill from wing of humming-bird,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shot from his eyes, and a keen stinging pain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sped through the open windows of her brain.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her senses failed, she sank upon the ground,</span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a><br /></span>

<span class="i0">Back from death's counterfeit, and looked around,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So little change was there, that it might seem<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The scene had been but a disordered dream.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Raven sat in his accustomed place,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Smoking his solitary pipe; his face,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A gloomy mask that none might penetrate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Betrayed no sign of anger, grief, or hate;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Absorbed so deep in thoughts that none might share,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He noted not Winona's presence there;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From his disdainful lips the thin blue smoke<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From time to time in little spirals broke,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Floating like languid sneers upon the air,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And settling round him in a veil of blue<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So sinister to her disordered view,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That she arose and quickly stole away.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She shunned him more than ever from that day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And never more unmoved could she behold<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That countenance inscrutable and cold.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But Hope and Love, like Indian summer's glow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gilding the prairies ere December's snow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lit with a transient beam Winona's eye.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The season for the Maidens' Dance drew nigh,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Redstar vowed, whatever might betide,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To claim her on the morrow as his bride.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What now to her was all the world beside?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The evil omens darkening all her sky,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Malicious sneers, her rival's envious eye,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">All passed like thistle-down unheeded by.</span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a><br /></span>
<span class="i0">The evening for the dance arrived at last;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An ancient crier through the village passed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And summoned all the maidens to repair<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the appointed place, a greensward where,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Since last year unprofaned by human feet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rustled the prairie grass and flowers sweet.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">None but the true and pure might enter there&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Maidens whose souls unspotted had been kept.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At set of sun the circle there was formed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thitherward the happy maidens swarmed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The people gathered round to view the scene:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Old men in broidered robes that trailing swept,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And youths in all their finery arrayed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dotting like tropic birds the prairie green,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their rival graces to the throng displayed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Winona came the last, but as she stept<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Into the mystic ring one word, "Beware!"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rang out in such a tone of high command<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That all was still, and every look was turned<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To where the Raven stood; his stern eye burned,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And like a flower beneath that withering glare<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She faded fast. No need that heavy hand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To lead Winona from the joyous band;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No need those shameful words that stained the air:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Let not the sacred circle be defiled<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By one who, all too easily beguiled,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beneath her bosom bears a warrior's child."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Winona swiftly fleeing, as she passed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One look upon her shrinking lover cast<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That seared his coward heart for many a day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Into the deepest woods she took her way.</span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a><br /></span>
<span class="i0">The dance was soon resumed, and as she fled,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like hollow laughter chasing overhead,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pursued the music and the maidens' song.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Just as she passed from sight an angry eye<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Glared for a moment from the western sky,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And flung one quivering shaft of dazzling white,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With tenfold thunder-peal, adown the night.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her mother followed her, and sought her long,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Calling and listening through the falling dew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While fast and furious still the cadence grew<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the gay dance, whose distant music fell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Smiting the mother like a funeral knell.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">High rode the sun in heaven next day before<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The stricken mother found along the shore<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The object of her unremitting quest.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The cooling wave whereon she lay at rest<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had stilled the tumult of Winona's breast<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Along that shapely ruin's plastic grace,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in the parting of her braided hair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The hopeless mother's glances searching there<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Thunder-Bird's mysterious mark might trace.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So died Winona, and let all beware,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For vengeance follows fast and will not spare,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor maid, nor warrior that dares offend<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who hath the cruel Thunder-Bird for friend.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Till it touched the top of heaven,<br /></span>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">At the doorway of his wigwam<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sat the ancient Arrow-maker,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the land of the Dacotas,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Making arrow-heads of jasper,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Arrow-heads of chalcedony.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At his side, in all her beauty,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sat the lovely Minnehaha,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sat his daughter, Laughing Water,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Plaiting mats of flags and rushes;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the past the old man's thoughts were,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the maiden's of the future.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">He was thinking, as he sat there,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the days when with such arrows<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He had struck the deer and bison,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On the Muskoday, the meadow;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shot the wild goose flying southward,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On the wing, the clamorous Wawa;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thinking of the great war-parties,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How they came to buy his arrows,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Could not fight without his arrows.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ah, no more such noble warriors,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Could be found on earth as they were!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now the men were all like women,</span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Only used their tongues for weapons!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">She was thinking of a hunter,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From another tribe and country,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Young and tall and very handsome,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who one morning, in the Spring-time,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Came to buy her father's arrows,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sat and rested in the wigwam,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lingered long about the doorway,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Looking back as he departed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She had heard her father praise him,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Praise his courage and his wisdom;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Would he come again for arrows<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the Falls of Minnehaha?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On the mat her hands lay idle,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And her eyes were very dreamy.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Through their thoughts they heard a footstep,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Heard a rustling in the branches,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And with glowing cheek and forehead,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With the deer upon his shoulders,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Suddenly from out the woodlands<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hiawatha stood before them.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Straight the ancient Arrow-maker<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Looked up gravely from his labor,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Laid aside the unfinished arrow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bade him enter at the doorway,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Saying, as he rose to meet him,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Hiawatha, you are welcome!"<br /></span>
<span class="i2">At the feet of Laughing Water<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hiawatha laid his burden,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Threw the red deer from his shoulders;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the maiden looked up at him,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Looked up from her mat of rushes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Said with gentle look and accent,</span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a><br /></span>
<span class="i0">"You are welcome, Hiawatha!"<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Very spacious was the wigwam,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Made of deer-skin dressed and whitened,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With the Gods of the Dakotas<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Drawn and painted on its curtains,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And so tall the doorway, hardly<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hiawatha stooped to enter,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hardly touched his eagle-feathers<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As he entered at the doorway.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Then uprose the Laughing Water,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From the ground fair Minnehaha,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Laid aside her mat unfinished,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Brought forth food and set before them,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Water brought them from the brooklet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gave them food in earthen vessels,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gave them drink in bowls of bass-wood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Listened while the guest was speaking,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Listened while her father answered,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But not once her lips she opened,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not a single word she uttered.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Yes, as in a dream she listened<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the words of Hiawatha,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As he talked of old Nokomis,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who had nursed him in his childhood.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As he told of his companions,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Chibiabos, the musician,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the very strong man, Kwasind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And of happiness and plenty<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the land of the Ojibways,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the pleasant land and peaceful.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">"After many years of warfare,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Many years of strife and bloodshed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There is peace between the Ojibways</span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the tribe of the Dakotas."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus continued Hiawatha,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And then added, speaking slowly,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"That this peace may last forever,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And our hands be clasped more closely,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And our hearts be more united,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Give me as my wife this maiden,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Minnehaha, Laughing Water,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Loveliest of Dakota women!"<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And the ancient Arrow-maker<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Paused a moment ere he answered,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Smoked a little while in silence,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Looked at Hiawatha proudly,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fondly looked at Laughing Water,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And made answer very gravely:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Yes, if Minnehaha wishes;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let your heart speak, Minnehaha!"<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And the lovely Laughing Water<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Seemed more lovely, as she stood there,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Neither willing nor reluctant,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As she went to Hiawatha,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Softly took the seat beside him,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While she said, and blushed to say it,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"I will follow you, my husband!"<br /></span>
<span class="i2">This was Hiawatha's wooing!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus it was he won the daughter<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the ancient Arrow-maker,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the land of the Dakotas!<br /></span>

<h3>EPIG&AElig;A REPENS.</h3>


<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">In the vast, primeval forest, unremembered moons ago,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When the streams were dumb and palsied, all the earth was white with snow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When the eerie wind went chasing evil spirits through the wood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Neath the gaunt and leafless tree-tops, an old Indian teepee stood.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In it lived an old man only, with white locks and flowing beard,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Clad in furs from head to foot-sole, like one to the north-land reared:<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Weakly his scant fire resisted the dread storm-fiend's icy breath,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And its deep, portentous rumblings spoke of swift approaching death.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Crouching there, "O Mannaboosho," cried he through the awful night,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Here behold me, thy brave warrior. I will conquer in thy might."</span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then the lodge door softly opened and in stepped a beauteous form<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Clad in ferns and sweet spring grasses. When she breathed, the air grew warm.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Large her eyes were, glowing brightly, as at night, the lustrous fawn's.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Red her cheeks were like wild roses or bright carmine-tinted dawns.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Long her hair and black as raven's, trailing o'er the frozen ground,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And her hands with pussy-willows, like close-fitting gloves were bound.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fair wild-flowers crowned her tresses and her dainty little feet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were encased in two white lilies from the great lakes pure and sweet.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Said the old man, "Ah, my daughter, I am glad to see you here.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though my lodge is cold and cheerless, it will shield you, never fear;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But pray tell me, fearless maiden, how these icy blasts you dare<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To confront in such strange clothing? Will you not the secret share?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I am old Kabibonokka, and my breath in ice congeals.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When I shake my locks, the snow falls. All the earth my power feels.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hastily the birds fly southward and the squirrels safely hide."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Ah how strange!" replied the maiden. "I spread beauty far and wide.</span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a><br /></span>
<span class="i0">When I shake my raven tresses, soft, warm rain falls from the sky,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All the birds come back a-building in the leafy tree-tops high."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus they talked, but soon the teepee grew like summer, strangely warm,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the old man's head dropped listless o'er a soundly-sleeping form.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">High the sun rode in the heavens, and a bluebird, pert and trim,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Called out, "Say-ee, I am thirsty;" and the rivers flowed for him.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As the old man slept, the maiden passed her hand above his head,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he smaller grew and smaller, till, all mortal substance sped,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But a mass of green leaves growing there remained upon the earth;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the fairy maiden stooping, with an air of quiet mirth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Took pink-tinted flowers and hid them all about beneath the leaves;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And her sweet, fresh breath upon them, like a spell she softly breathes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As she sings with clear, wild warblings, "of my graces, I give all;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And who shall desire to pluck thee, on his bended knees shall fall."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then as onward moved the maiden, through the woods and o'er the plains,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All the jocund birds sang to her, o'er her fell the spring-time rains,</span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the arbutus in beauty, 'neath her fairy footsteps sprung.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nowhere else in vale or woodland were the precious seedlets flung.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Still Northern Minnesota, near the great unsalted sea,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Trace we will the maiden's footsteps where these self-same blossoms be.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">In the days that are forgotten,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dwelt a tall and tawny hunter&mdash;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Son of Waub-Ojeeg,<a name="FNanchor_21_22" id="FNanchor_21_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_22" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> the warrior,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Strong was he and fleet as roebuck,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Brave was he and very stealthy;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Grappled with Makw&aacute;,<a name="FNanchor_22_23" id="FNanchor_22_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_23" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> the monster,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Took his black hide for a blanket.</span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a><br /></span>
<span class="i0">When the Panther wed the Sea-Gull,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Young was he and very gladsome;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fair was she and full of laughter;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like the robin in the spring-time,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sang from sunrise till the sunset;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For she loved the handsome hunter.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Deep as Gitchee Gumee's waters<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was her love&mdash;as broad and boundless;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the wedded twain were happy&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Happy as the mated robins.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When their first-born saw the sunlight<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Joyful was the heart of Panther,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Proud and joyful was the mother,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All the days were full of sunshine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All the nights were full of starlight.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nightly from the land of spirits<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On them smiled the starry faces&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Faces of their friends departed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Little moccasins she made him,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Feathered cap and belt of wampum<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From the hide of fawn a blanket,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fringed with feathers, soft as sable;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Singing at her pleasant labor,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And the little hunter in it.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oft the Panther smiled and fondled,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Smiled upon the babe and mother,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Frolicked with the boy and fondled.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tall he grew and like his father,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And they called the boy the Raven&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Called him K&acirc;k-k&acirc;h-g&egrave;&mdash;the Raven.<br /></span>

<h3>A LEGEND OF DAHKOTAH LAND.</h3>


<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Within the forest, by a crystal spring<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where I, a weary hunter, paused to fling<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My form at length upon the velvet bank,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And from the cool, delicious water drank<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A draught so comforting it well might seem<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The fabled fount of Ponce de Leon's dream,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I met an aged half-breed, on whose cheek<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The marks of seasons wild and winters bleak<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were softened by the warm light from the west&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sunset&mdash;the last day-beauty, and the best!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beside the spring he sat and gazed and dreamed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In melancholy silence, till it seemed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His very soul was pouring from his eyes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And melting in that mirror, where the skies<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were glassed in all their purity, and where<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No ripple reached the surface from the fair<br /></span>
<span class="i0">White bosom of the palpitating sand,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A constant flowing breast o'er Nature's grand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tender, never weary heart! 'Twas life<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of her life which I quaffed; 'twas sweet, and rife<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With flavor from foundations of her hills:</span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a><br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Twas strong with her strength; throbbing with her thrills;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Enriched with her untainted blood; a part<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of that divinity which rules my heart!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus when at last I drew my lips away,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in the quiet of the closing day<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gave voice to my delight, the old man turned<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To meet my glance. His deep eyes lit and burned<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With growing brightness, and he softly said:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"This spring is sacred for the holy dead;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The spirit of Sweet Water lingers here;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The powers of mystery and reverent fear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And lovely death brood o'er this sleeping wave&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A monument for one who had no grave."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Forthwith he poured into my willing ear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A tale so wondrous I must tell it here:<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">One morning in the strawberry moon,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her heart with Nature's heart in tune<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A maid went forth to meet the sun.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That wonderous alchemist of day<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With mystic pigments had begun<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To tint the dark with twilight gray;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On mystic fans the breezy hills<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bestirred the air with perfumed thrills,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And mystic voices tried to tell<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What dewy benedictions fell<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through all the silent hours of night.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The bend of eastern sky grew light<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With mystic rays of silver-green,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Soon vanished in a violet sheen;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And this fair, mystic phantom flew<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Before a potent golden hue.</span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a><br /></span>
<span class="i0">The maiden idly wandered over<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Banks of moss and beds of clover,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pausing as she strolled along<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To hear the sweetest wildwood song,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or watch the butterfly whose flight<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From meadow bloom to forest flower<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Enticed her pleasure-searching sight<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With Nature's happiest power.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She passed along a forest trail<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Neath trees that thrilled with morning life;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Above the song-birds' concert strife<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She heard the blithesome call of quail,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The scornful cry of blue-jay dressed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In splendid robes, with lordly crest.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Twas joy to see, 'twas joy to hear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Twas joy to wander without fear.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O lightsome heart! O peaceful breast!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where yet no passion brought unrest!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gayly she tripped, unconscious all<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That any danger might befall.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But suddenly the song-birds fled<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From all the branches overhead.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then on her startled hearing rang<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sharp and vengeful bow-string's twang<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A whizz&mdash;a yell&mdash;a writhing mass<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fell on the path she thought to pass&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A tawny panther from whose side<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An arrow drained the living tide.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With shrinking eyes she saw the beast<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rolling in agony, until<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At last the sensate struggles ceased,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all that mighty frame was still.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While she was wondering whose keen sight<br /></span>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So well had sped the arrow's flight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A tall young brave stepped from the wood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And silently before her stood.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He gazed enraptured on her face,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her womanly charms, her youthful grace;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And when he spoke, it was to tell<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The flattering things that win so well.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She saw that he was one who fought<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Against her father's tribe, but naught<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Availed that knowledge for defense<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Against his passionate eloquence,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And ere they parted on that morn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Within her breast young Love was born.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They met again, and many times,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As young hearts have in many climes.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At last, upon a starry night,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unable longer to resist,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She gave up all and took her flight<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And went with him where he might list.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While they had lingered in their love,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The stars had swiftly marched above&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thus it chanced that on their way<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They met the heralds of the day.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her lover led through forests dim,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He brought her to the river bank;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His light canoe, all tight and trim,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He drew from grasses tall and rank.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They pushed away; no time was lost,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And soon the placid stream was crossed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Again they plunged among the trees.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Although no doubt had power to seize<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon the maiden's heart, she feared<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And wondered that her brave appeared</span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a><br /></span>
<span class="i0">To lose his wonted care; she knew<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Twas strange to leave their tried canoe,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But went, unquestioning, and thought<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His deeds would bring her fears to naught.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To her astonishment, he led<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her from the forest's sheltering spread<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Into a small and star-lit glade,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, turning to her, softly bade<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her fear not, for a warlike band<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Encompassed them on every hand.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They were her lover's friends in arms,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The war paint on their faces filled<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her faithful breast with wild alarms,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For she herself would fain be killed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A thousand times than that her flight<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Should lead her own to death that night.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She clasped his arm with trembling hand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And lifted to his bold black eyes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A look he could but ill withstand&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Love's first reproach, doubt's first surmise.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From cold, white lips her question broke:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Why do we thus these warriors meet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So near the lodges of my folk?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Why do you thus their presence greet?"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Before his tongue could make reply,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A burly warrior, standing by,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Strode forward, and, with murderous look,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His tomahawk before her shook,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And fiercely said: "I am Two Bear;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Great chief am I! 'Tis sweet to tear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The craven hearts and drink the blood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Two Bear's foes; a big red flood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall flow from coward Sioux, this morn</span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their scalps Ojibway spears adorn.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Why have you kept us waiting here?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Behold, the sun will soon appear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The hour is late, the good time flies,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And vengeance still unsated cries!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Come," growled the brute, and clutched her wrist,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And gave it rough and cruel twist;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Come, lead us now, with noiseless creep,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To where thy Sioux dogs lie in sleep."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like thunderbolt from storm-filled air,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The young brave sprang upon Two Bear;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With mighty grasp he whirled him 'round<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And threw him fiercely to the ground.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Dog thou," he cried; "and darest thou pain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This beauty with thy paws again<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I'll kill thee, ponderous as thou art!"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Black with the fury in his heart,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The bully rose, and toward the young<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And fearless champion wildly flung<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His tomahawk, which, lightly dodged,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Swung through the hissing air and lodged<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Deep in the nearest cottonwood.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Brief were the moments while they stood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And glared into each other's eyes.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then forward leaped, with fearful cries,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And joined in combat, hand to hand.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With whirlwind sweep their knives outflashed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And lightning followed when they clashed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The maiden stood in dumb surprise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All heedless of the warrior band;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Too anxious for her lover's fate<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To think upon his present state,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or care what stir she might create.</span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sternly the conflict raged. At length,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Although he fought with giant strength,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The youthful brave was overpowered.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He fell; a crushing knee was pressed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon his form, his foeman towered<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A moment o'er him, then his breast<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Received the cruel, plunging knife.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The crimson flood gushed forth; a thrill<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of anguish swept his features o'er;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The light departed; mortal strife<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Would stir the living pulse no more<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Within that ghastly form so still!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her lover's awful death awoke<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The maiden from her flight-born trance.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She flashed around one fearful glance&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The peril of her people broke<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon her mind; she must be brave,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For she alone could hope to save.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She saw with horror and alarm<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Two Bear approach herself to claim<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As prize for his victorious arm;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His wicked face was all aflame.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Twas worse than death for her to stay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And she must warn those far away.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No time was her's for useless grief.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She turned, and like a storm-chased leaf,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fled swiftly toward the river bank.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Alas! A dozen leaps were all.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The murderous tomahawk was thrown<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And cleft her brain. With one low moan,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon her green death-bed she sank.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But simultaneous with her fall<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A wild Dahkotah war-whoop rang</span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a><br /></span>
<span class="i0">From out the forest, and a wall<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of warriors rose on every hand.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With common stroke their bow-strings' twang<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sounded death to that fated band.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The avengers closed upon their foe,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And ere they ceased the conflict wild,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Laid every feathered top-knot low;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In heaps Ojibway braves were piled.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When all the last red scalps were torn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They turned to find the murdered maid.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All in her tribe would rise and mourn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When dead before them she was laid.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But strange event! With wondering tone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Each asked of each where she had flown.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In vain they searched. They found her not;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But there, upon the very spot<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where she had fallen, a fountain gushed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which never man had seen before.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They gathered round with breathing hushed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And gazed, and wondered more and more.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While every grass-blade growing near<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was red and matted thick with gore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The overflow was sweet and clear;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The bosom of the bubbling spring<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was spotless as a spirit's wing.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With single voice they all proclaimed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The magic spot a sacred place.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The vanished girl was thenceforth named<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Sweet Water," and to see her face<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dahkotah hearts will journey here<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till from the earth they disappear;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And when they die, their souls shall know<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The secret of its crystal flow.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">While the swift-footed hunters by land ran the shores for the elk and the bison.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like <i>mag&aacute;s</i><a name="FNanchor_46_47" id="FNanchor_46_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_47" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> ride the birchen canoes on the breast of the dark, winding river,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By the willow-fringed island they cruise, by the grassy hills green to their summits;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By the lofty bluffs hooded with oaks that darken the deep with their shadows;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And bright in the sun gleam the strokes of the oars in the hands of the women.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With the band went Winona. The oar plied the maid with the skill of a hunter.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">There the fleet hunters followed the deer, and the thorny <i>pahin</i> for the women.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From the <i>tees</i> rose the smoke of good cheer, curling blue through the tops of the maples,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Near the foot of a cliff that arose, like the battle-scarred walls of a castle,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Up-towering, in rugged repose, to a dizzy height over the waters.</span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a><br /></span>

<span class="i0">The gifts to the <i>teepee</i> were brought&mdash;the blankets and beads of the White men,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Winona, the orphaned, was bought by the crafty, relentless Tamd&oacute;ka.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the Spring-time of life, in the flush of the gladsome mid-May days of Summer,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When the bobolink sang and the thrush, and the red robin chirped in the branches,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">She must sit in the lodge of her foe, as a slave at the feet of her master.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Alas for her waiting! the wings of the East-wind have brought her no tidings;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On the meadow the meadow-lark sings, but sad is her song to Winona,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the glad warbler's melody brings but the memory of voices departed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Day-Spirit walked in the west to his lodge in the land of the shadows;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His shining face gleamed on the crest of the oak-hooded hills and the mountains,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the meadow-lark hied to her nest, and the mottled owl peeped from her cover.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But hark! from the <i>teepees</i> a cry! Hear the shouts of the hurrying warriors!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are the feet of the enemy nigh,&mdash;of the crafty and cruel Ojibways?</span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a><br /></span>

<h3>THE DESCENDING STAR.</h3>

<div class="footnote"><p>This legend is related by Kah-ge-ga-gah-bawh, chief of the
Ojibway Nation, or Chippewas, in his "Traditional History of
the Ojibway Nation" purporting to be the first volume of
Indian history written by an Indian. In common with his forest
brethren, he "was brought up in the woods." Twenty months
passed in a school in Illinois constituted the sum-total of his
schooling. But he had learned the traditions of his people, as
was customary, from the lips of the chief, his father.</p>

<p>Through the stilted language of this somewhat unlettered
Indian we catch faint glimpses of the poetic beauty with which
the tradition glowed when actually related at the wigwam
door. An attempt has been made to retain and crystallize this
poetic beauty in the preceding metrical version of the Indian
legend.</p></div>


<h3>THE TRAILING ARBUTUS.</h3>

<div class="footnote"><p>A new version of the beautiful and popular legend of the
first spring flower, making the visitant to the old man's lodge
a maiden, and identifying the blossom as the trailing arbutus,
was told by Hon. C. L. Belknap of Michigan before the Folk-Lore
Society in Washington, Dec., 1891.</p></div>

always shrewd enough to look out for himself in all his treaties
and transactions with the Government. He stood six feet two
inches in his moccasins, was well-proportioned, and had a remarkably
fine face. He had a nickname&mdash;<i>Que-we-z&aacute;nc</i> (Little
Boy)&mdash;by which he was familiarly called by his people.
</p><p>
The Pillagers&mdash;<i>Nah-k&aacute;nd-tway-we-nin-ni-wak</i>&mdash;who live
about Leech Lake (<i>Kah-sah-gah-squah-g-me-cock</i>) were opposed
to <i>Pa-go-nay-gie-shiek</i>, but he compelled them through
fear to recognize him as Head-Chief. At the time of the
"Sioux outbreak" in 1862 "Hole-in-the-day" for a time apparently
meditated an alliance with the Po-&aacute;h-nuck (Dakotas)
and war upon the whites. The Pillagers and some other
bands urged him strongly to this course, and his supremacy as
head-chief was threatened unless he complied. Messengers
from the Dakotas were undoubtedly received by him, and he,
for a time at least, led the Dakotas to believe that their hereditary
enemies, the Ojibways, would bury the hatchet and join
them in a war of extermination against the whites. "Hole-in-the-day,"
with a band of his warriors, appeared opposite Fort
Ripley (situated on the west bank of the Mississippi River
between Little Falls and Crow Wing), and assumed a threatening
attitude toward the fort, then garrisoned by volunteer<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
troops. The soldiers were drawn up on the right bank and
"Hole-in-the-day" and his warriors on the left. A little
speech-making settled the matter for the time being and very
soon thereafter a new treaty was made with "Hole-in-the-day"
and his head men, by which their friendship and allegiance
were secured to the whites. It was claimed by the Pillagers
that "Hole-in-the-day" seized the occasion to profit personally
in his negotiations with the agents of the Government.
</p><p>
In 1867 "Hole-in-the-day" took "another wife." He
married Helen McCarty, a white woman, in Washington, D. C.,
and took her to his home at Gull Lake (<i>Ka-ga-ya-sk&uacute;nc-cock</i>)
literally, <i>plenty of little gulls</i>.
</p><p>
She bore him a son who is known as Joseph H. Woodbury,
and now (1891) resides in the city of Minneapolis. His marriage
with a white woman increased the hatred of the Pillagers,
and they shot him from ambush and killed him near <i>Ninge-t&aacute;-we-de-gu&aacute;-yonk</i>&mdash;Crow
Wing&mdash;on the 27th day of June, 1868.
</p><p>
At the time of his death, "Hole-in-the-day" was only thirty-seven
years old, but had been recognized as Head-Chief for a
long time. He could speak some English, and was far above
the average of white men in native shrewdness and intelligence.
He was thoroughly posted in the traditions and legends of his
people.
</p><p>
The Ojibways have for many years been cursed by contact
with the worst elements of the whites, and seem to have adopted
the vices rather than the virtues of civilization. I once
spoke of this to "Hole-in-the-day." His reply was terse and
truthful&mdash;"<i>M&aacute;dg&egrave; tche-m&oacute;-ko-mon, m&aacute;dg&egrave; a-nische-n&aacute;b&eacute;:
men&oacute;g&eacute; tche-m&oacute;-ko-mon, men&oacute; a-nisch&egrave;-n&aacute;b&egrave;.</i>&mdash;Bad white men,
bad Indians: good white men, good Indians."</p></div>
